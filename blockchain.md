* For a good general idea of the concept, [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4&vl=en) does a good job.<br/>
* A deep understanding of cryptography is not essential. Cryptography resources can be found [here](https://github.com/bitsacm/Slack-Stock-DAG/blob/master/cryptography.md). For a sufficient high-level overview of concepts, the first half of Chapter 2 of the book “Beginning Blockchain” by Bikramaditya Singhal, Gautam Dhameja, Priyansu Sekhar Panda is good.  The book can be found on libgen.

* [List of articles](https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/blockchain) referred to by above course.
* [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). For Bitcoin scripting, aforementioned “Beginning Blockchain” (Chapter 3) provides a nice step by step explanation of the procedure.<br/>
* [Ethereum whitepaper]( https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/). The Ethereum [website]( https://ethereum.org/en/) is also a good starting point for learning about smart contracts, etc. There’s even a overthewire type wargame wherein each level is a smart contract that needs to be hacked.

* Blockgeeks has good guides/articles like [1]( https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology/), [2]( https://blockgeeks.com/guides/blockchain-consensus/), [3](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/blockchain-scalability/)  and many more.<br/>
* For an overview of Hyperledger Fabric, Lecture videos 19-22 of [these]( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFW6lRTa1g80R3Q_5-jsNVhDFAeGaABo9) playlist of lectures by IIT Kanpur and the [official docs]( https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/whatis.html) of Hyperledger Fabric are a great place to start.<br/>
