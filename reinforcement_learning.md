## Reinforcement Learning

RL is very mathematical. It is advisable to keep the following prereqs ready before starting out with RL. (Look at the respective `topic.md` files in Slack-Stock-DAG):
- Python
- Calculus
- Probability and Statistics
- Linear Algebra
- ML and DL
- PyTorch (or Tensorflow)
- Data Structures and Algorithms

Here's the Pathway for RL:

- Watch David Silver's [course](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/) on RL basics.
- Read the first 7 chapters of [Hands on Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.amazon.in/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-Q-networks-ebook/dp/B076H9VQH6) to get an idea of how DL and RL meet and how DQNs work and also some nice exposure to code.
- [Deep RL Bootcamp](https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/lectures) and [CS285](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) are the most important courses for RL (in 2020). Use them for building up a strong theoretical background.
- At any point you want to get deeper into any classic RL algorithm, dig deeper into the respective chapter in [Sutton Barto 2e](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf)
- When you want to practice DQNs and PGs, you can take help from these implementations: [Rainbow is all you need](https://github.com/Curt-Park/rainbow-is-all-you-need) and [PG is all you need](https://github.com/MrSyee/pg-is-all-you-need).
- Read a lot of papers, try out own experiments, etc. [Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/) should help a lot with this.
