## Learning Computational Geometry
One approach to learning Computational Geometry is as follows,
1. Week 1 - Week 5: Coursera - Computational Geometry
    - This part is more practice-oriented.
    - For theory, read from textbook and/or random resources off the internet. Philipp's lectures are also a great source.
    - Focus on the problemset for the course. Remember to pay special attention to the edge cases.
    - Recommended Prerequisite: Good understanding and practice of DSA. Some of the problems have tons of edge cases!
2. Week 6 - Week 10: Philipp Kindermann's Lecture Series
    - This part is more theory oriented and covers Voronoi Diagrams, Delaunay Triangulations too.
    - Again some parts can be followed up from the text book (Berg) as well.
    - Recommended Prerequisite: Basic graph theory (maximal planar graph, duals), basic DSA (time complexity)

Review notes for this is [available here](https://cheese-cracker.github.io/note/2020/10/01/compgeom.html)

For those interested only in the theory, follow Philipp's Lectures from week 1-10 complete, in conjunction with the textbook.

For further knowledge, you could also glance through the book by Hanan Samet or [Journal of Computational Geometry](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computational-geometry/) Papers.
